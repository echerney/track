      <h2>Living with depression is hard enough. You shouldn't have to deal with it alone.</h2>
      <p>Our aim is to make things a little easier for you while you're dealing with depression. Sometimes you need help tracking your symptoms, sometimes you need gentle self-care reminders, and sometimes you need more help than an app can offer (although we hope to help you find it.)</p>
      <p>If you're in crisis, feel free to use the button below to find nearby mental health facilities. If you want to take a symptom assessment, create an account or login to the right.</p>
